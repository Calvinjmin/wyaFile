# wyaFile

| **A modern, privacy-focused file indexing and search utility for your local text files.**

**wyaFile** empowers you to quickly explore and analyze your local text files with speed, precision, and privacy at its core.

## What Does it Do? (Current Features)

Right now, wyaFile provides a robust command-line interface (CLI) to:

* **Scan Directories:** Quickly process all plain text (`.txt`) files within a specified directory.
* **Find Keywords:** Search indexed files for specific keywords, returning all files that contain them.

## Roadmap & Future Vision

wyaFile's long-term vision is to become your go-to solution for local file exploration and analysis. We're building a tool that:

* **Replaces Generic System Search:** Offering a more efficient, customizable, and intelligent alternative.
* **Handles Diverse File Types:** Expanding beyond `.txt` to support PDFs, Word documents, and other common formats.
* **Delivers Advanced Search:** Implementing intelligent indexing and ranking algorithms for highly relevant results.

### Next Steps

I am actively working on:

* **Keyword-Driven Input:** Refactoring the CLI to focus on directly taking a keyword for search, providing a more intuitive user experience.
* **Enhanced Interface:** Exploring improvements to the command-line interface for better usability and feedback.
