# wyaFile

| **A modern, privacy-focused file indexing and search utility for your local text files.**

**wyaFile** empowers you to quickly explore and analyze your local text files.

## What Does it Do? (Current Features)

Right now, wyaFile acts as a command-line interface with the following capabilities:

* **Scan Directories:** Quickly process all supported files (`.txt`, `.csv`) files within a specified directory.

## Roadmap & Future Vision

wyaFile's long-term vision is to become a quick indexing tool for file storages.

* **Replaces Generic System Search:** Offering a more efficient, customizable, and intelligent alternative.
* **Handles Diverse File Types:** Expanding beyond `.txt` to support PDFs, Word documents, and other common formats.
* **Delivers Advanced Search:** Implementing intelligent indexing and ranking algorithms for highly relevant results.

### Next Steps

I am actively working on:

* **Keyword-Driven Input:** Refactoring the CLI to focus on directly taking a keyword for search
* **Enhanced Interface:** Exploring improvements to the command-line interface for better usability and feedback.
