## Roadmap & Future Vision

wyaFile's long-term vision is to become a quick indexing tool for file storages.

* **Replaces Generic System Search:** Offering a more efficient, customizable, and intelligent alternative.
* **Handles Diverse File Types:** Expanding beyond `.txt` to support PDFs, Word documents, and other common formats.
* **Delivers Advanced Search:** Implementing intelligent indexing and ranking algorithms for highly relevant results.
* **AI Integration:** Searching via keywords will include AI to enhance the 'fuzzy-search' functionality.

### Next Steps

I am actively working on:

* **Threading:** Utilize C++'s native threading capabilities to improve performance.
* **AI Integration:** Using open-source models, like Llama or Gemini, to enhance the searching capabilities.
* **Enhanced Interface:** Exploring improvements to the command-line interface for better usability and feedback.
